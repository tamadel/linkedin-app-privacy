# Bio material for the agent

## One line
Data Engineer in Switzerland. I build reliable pipelines, incremental sync, and analytics layers. I also build small AI agents for boring work.

## Short bio bullets
- Data Engineer and Data Analyst
- Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, SQL Server, AWS, Azure, Microsoft Fabric storage patterns
- ETL and ELT pipelines, batch and near real time sync
- Medallion layers: Bronze, Silver, Gold
- Geospatial data and POI enrichment in Switzerland
- Query performance, data quality, idempotency, and observability
- Power BI reporting readiness

## Credibility proof pool, safe for public
- Built incremental sync patterns using per row hashing and idempotent upserts
- Designed schemas and layer separation for analytics ready data
- Worked with large tables and long running loads, focused on speed and correctness
- Automated boring operations with scripts and small agent loops

## Topics you should avoid in public
- Employer names, client names, internal system names
- Hostnames, IPs, database names, restore schedules, exact row counts from production
- Screenshots of dashboards, logs, code containing secrets, or config files
